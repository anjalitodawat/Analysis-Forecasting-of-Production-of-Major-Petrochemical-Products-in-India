#📊 Analysis & Forecasting of Major Petrochemical Products in India
##📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on the analysis and forecasting of production trends of major petrochemical products in India using time series analysis. The study applies ARIMA models to historical production data to forecast future production levels.
The project was completed as part of the M.Sc. Statistics (IV Semester) curriculum at Mohanlal Sukhadia University, Udaipur.

##🎯 Objectives
-Analyze production trends of major petrochemical products in India
-Visualize historical production data (2014–2022)
-Forecast future production for selected products using ARIMA models
-Apply statistical and time series concepts using R programming

##🧪 Products Analyzed
The analysis focuses primarily on the following major petrochemical products:
-Ethylene
-Propylene
-Polypropylene
These products were selected due to their significant contribution to India’s petrochemical industry.

##📂 Dataset
Source: Government of India – data.gov.in
Ministry: Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers
Time Period: 2014–2022
Unit: Metric Tons (MT)
The data includes production figures reported by large and medium-scale manufacturers monitored by the Statistics & Monitoring (S&M) Division.

##🧠 Methodology
-Time Series Analysis
